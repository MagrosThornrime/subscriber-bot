# Description
Sometimes your community uses some particular website/app outside
of the Discord. For example, you have created your own video game and
built a large community around it. Now you want to notify them if a new patch
was added to the game. Your game has an official website, where you
put all those articles about your game. So, using my bot, you can
forget about notifying your players on Discord - it will do it for you.

Another example: you and your friends play another, bigger MMO.
You want to follow all the neat posts from the game-related forums.
You also want to follow the rankings and YouTube channels.
Sure, you don't need any bots for this. But if you spend so much time on
Discord, it will be easier to put all the notifications in one place,
just next to text and voice channels, so you can discuss new content
the moment they appear.

My bot supports managing all the subscriptions and how their
content is shown on Discord channels. It is meant to be flexible -
so if you want to follow some specific website, you can just fork it
and write your own plugin for this. I provide an API for you to code
the plugins.
