# Description
My bot allows to subscribe to its plugins. If you subscribe to a plugin, it will send you some messages to your channel with a given period. So you can subscribe to some scraper and it will send you a list of new posts on your favorite gaming forum every 1 hour.

# Roadmap:
## Before 1.0.0:
- a first usable plugin (preferably a scraper)
- task editing
- slash commands descriptions
- /help command
- clean_up upgrade
- some major exceptions handled
- debug logs
- packaging (probably using Pyinstaller)
- LICENSE (MIT maybe?)
- mentions and tag sent before other messages
- every plugin has its own directory (so you can create complex ones using many files and store your logs)
- list_tasks parsing
- /run_task slash command
